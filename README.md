This is a copy from [Google Code](https://code.google.com/p/hapax2/)
packaged as an Android library with a small modification to the
`TemplateResourceLoader` to be able to load templates from the `assets` folder.

Code was auto-reformatted to get close to the
[Android Code Style Guidelines](https://source.android.com/source/code-style.html).

TODO:
- Adapt code style to Android style guide, esp. private properties' names.
- Add JavaDoc.
